This Flutter application showcases a unique and interactive way to display a list of programming languages. The ListWheelScrollView widget is utilized to create a wheel-like interface, allowing users to scroll through the list with a visually appealing effect. The app also features a text field for users to input new programming languages, which can be added to the list with the press of a button. Additionally, the list can be shuffled or the last item can be removed with the use of two other floating action buttons. This project demonstrates a creative approach to displaying data in a Flutter application and can be easily customized to fit various use cases.
